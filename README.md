## About me

I'm game and web developer that love to make dreams become reality. As a programmer, i'm constant trying to learn new features and tools to make my work better and faster. As a game developer, i'm always making games and trying new things and perspectives, been part of gamejams and things that push my imagination forward.

Collab and help the projects that i use to use is one thing i really like to do. Make collaborative projects with others (mainly games) is what makes me happy in the end of the day.
